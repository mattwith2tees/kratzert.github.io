People come to me all the time asking about becoming a programmer. Wanting to know where to start. What classes to take. And if school is even necessary to land that programming job.

I get so many inquiries about my job, that I decided to craft up an **Intro to Software Engineering - Prerequisite** course for anyone interested in deep diving into the engineering world.

So let's start off by clarifying what my exact job title is, because I hear the terms __programmer__, and __coder__ thrown around interchangeably to describe what I do. I do not consider myself neither of those. Instead, I am a classified as a **Software Engineer** or **Software Developer** - simply engineer or developer for short. Programmers and coders are individuals that primarily do just that, code and write programs. But that's not **all** that I do. In fact, my job description entails much more than just writing code. I'm expected to build applications from end-to-end, and that will be used at scale. From applications hosted in the Cloud or on-prem, data pipelines, to APIs and microservices. And it's more to those than just hashing out code.  __But I can get into all of this in another post__.

## Now that we've gotten that out of the way.

We can talk about what to expect while on your path to becoming an engineer:

1. **A lot of reading and research**

So far, I've been working professionally for 2 years now, and til this day, I find myself browsing the web and researching how to fix errors in my code or solve simple problems. Experience makes all the differnce, but even senior engineers rely on Google and StackOverflow to get them through their certain problems. Besides, it's way too much out there to know everything.

This is **one** of my browsers as we speak. And this is on a good day.

2. **Continuously learning and changing**

Technology changes, and it changes fast. So you have to be prepared it. That includes being aware of new services, features for libraries your applications may use. Just look at how fast AWS's service catalog has grown over the years. Along with that, you have to make sure that you stay on top of the new technologies and frameworks if you want to remain competitive in this industry. In today's technology climate, you should have experience or knowledge of one of the major cloud providers.

3. **Stess**

You should definitely expect some stressful nights.
