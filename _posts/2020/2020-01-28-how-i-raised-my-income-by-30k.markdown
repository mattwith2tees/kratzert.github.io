I graduated from college in December of 2017, and started my career that following January. I didn't have a job lined up before walking across that stage, so I was honestly willing to take the first thing that was handed to me. Yes, I had countless interviews, really good ones, but they went nowhere. When I had the first offer on the table, I lunged at it with no questions. No negotiating. Nothing. I had no leverage. Home Depot got a steal. I was fresh meat, right out of college. Don't get me wrong, the money was good, but I know I could've gotten a little more.

Fast forward to February of 2019, when I didn't get the promotion I was due for and expecting, I began looking for a new opportunity. After some time of prepping and interviewing, I was able get an offer that was reasonable, from Equifax. With experience under my belt, this recruiting process was much different.

This time, I made my presence. I controlled the interviews, showcased my skills, and proved my knowledge. Which means that when it came to talking about that bag. I. Had. Leverage.

Leverage

**Before** you even start applying for jobs. Figure out what skills you need to have in order for you to have leverage.
