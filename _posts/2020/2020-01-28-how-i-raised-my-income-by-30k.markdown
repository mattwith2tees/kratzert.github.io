I graduated from college in December of 2017, and started my career that following January (2018). I didn't have a job lined up before walking across that stage. It was nerve-racking because I had countless interviews, _really good ones_, but they just went **nowhere**. So, I was honestly willing to take the first thing that was handed to me.

When I finally had that first offer on the table (Home Depot), I lunged at it with no questions. No negotiating. Nothing. Why? Because I had **no** leverage and I felt desperate. I was fresh meat, right out of college, with nothing on my resume to vouch for me. Don't get me wrong, the money was good, but I still felt like it was less than I was worth.

Fast forward to February of 2019, when I didn't get the promotion I was expecting, I began looking for a new opportunity. After some time of prepping and interviewing, I was able get an offer from Equifax that was reasonable. This recruiting process was much different.

This time, I made my presence and value be known. **I** controlled the interviews. And how do you control an interview? By asking great questions, tying in your knowledge with their current project(s), and by providing insight and being engaged. I accomplished some pretty cool things at Home Depot and was a part of a really transformational project. Along with that, I acquired some new skills revolving around technology that is in high demand. Because of that, I was able to convince them that I could <u>add value</u>. **I. Had. Leverage.**

The key takeaway from this is:
<center><h1>Leverage</h1></center>

You can't have leverage if you don't have value. **Before** you even start applying for jobs. Figure out what technologies are currently **HOT** in your industry and what particular technologies your potential employers are looking for candidates to possess. Then, align your resume with those technologies. Whether you are incorporating those technologies on projects in your current role (ideal), or taking the time out to use those technologies on personal projects, get that experience in. You don't have to be an expert, just be able to hold a decent conversation about the tech, and have opinions and insight.

This means, stop wasting your time doing menial tasks at work. Quit accepting busy work from your manager. If you feel like you're not being challenged enough, __tell your manager to move you to another project__, or just switch teams within your organization. If all of that isn't possible, start your own projects on the side in your free time. Familiarize yourself with EC2 and App Engine, create and load data into MySQL or Postgres, construct a small data pipeline, or build a simple React app. Anything to get a little experience under your belt. A few hours of this per day will give you leverage. I promise.

So when it comes time to interview, you're controlling the interviews by asking detailed questions about their tech stack, you're showing curiousity about their CI/CD maturity, and providing insight on their current data pipelines, etc.

And that's exactly what I did. I touched as many Google Cloud products as I could while at Home Depot, constructed data pipelines using a range a technologies, got hands-on experience with Jenkins, maintained our java applications, and really improved on my SQL skills. I understood that all of these technologies were hot and would boost my stock price, so I made a concious effort to touch all of these things. By no means, do I call myself an expert. Even today. But when it came time to prove that I could add value, I did just that. And with that, came the leverage. I was able to negotiate my salary, and by May of 2019, I got that 20k increase.

I eventually left Equifax that following November, where I saw another 10k increase by using that same strategy. Be more strategic on your job hunt and start applying to jobs where your skills align with what their looking for. If you add value, you have leverage and have the upperhand when negotiating money.

Also, a big thing to remember while you're going through the recruiting process, is that these companies need <u>you</u> and not the other way around. They spend thousands of dollars by sending you through the recruiting process, because they want you. So approach interviews with confidence. Think of it like this: __It's not a matter of why that company should hire you. It's a matter of why you should join their company__. And with that simple truth, you already have one up on every employer you interview with. Hopefully that gives you a little more confidence going into your next interview.

I may follow this blog post up with interview tips and how to properly negotiate your salary. If you're interested in that. Let me know.
