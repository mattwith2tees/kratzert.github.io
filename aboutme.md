I'm a Georgia State University grad with a B.B.A in Computer Information Systems. Immediately after school, I worked at The Home Depot as a Software Engineer. I joined during their migration to Google Cloud Platform, so that is where I got introduced to the Cloud and Data Engineering. After Home Depot, I found my way at Equifax where I did a lot of application development, building Spring Batch applications to assist with yet another migration. But instead, to AWS. Currently, I'm a Data Engineering Consultant at Slalom Build
