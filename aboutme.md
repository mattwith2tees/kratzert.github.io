I'm Matt Turner, a software engineer who specializes in data engineering with an interest in Cloud technologies, data warehousing, and all things data.

As I go through my career, striving to become the best professional I can be, I can't help but realize how unprepared I was for the challenges that came with starting a career after school. I'm a firm believer in higher education nonetheless, but there are a lot of things that your professors and advisors just don't teach you, or simply fail to mention about this transition.

My experience began as a clueless intern at **Synchrony Financial** midway through college, to currently working as a data engineering consultant at **Slalom Build**. Between those two points in my career, I've found myself teaching the next generation of women engineers at **Girls Who Code**, being a part of a major technological transformation at **Home Depot**,  and contributing to **Equifax's** transition to a more technology-centered approach in credit reporting.

When I'm not at work constructing data pipelines, I spend most of my time with my girlfriend, G'vanni; playing fetch with my dog, Champ; or casually sipping on a glass of Jack and lemonade while playing a game of Call of Duty or NBA 2K with the guys. Among those things, I also like coaching the up-and-coming _tech geeks_; lending a hand to help get their foot in the door, or advising them on how to structure their resumes and acing those interviews. So, I started this blog to share those lessons on a larger scale. Whether you are a student pursuing a career in tech, or a super mom who wants to learn how to build your own website, I can provide you with the knowledge and resources you need, while guiding you along the way.

I won't go as far as to say that I'm an expert in career development, or that I know all of the secrets to thrive in your career. Honestly, I'm still unsure about mine at times. However, the strategies and techniques that I've applied in my life over the last few years have had a significant impact on my career and just me as a professional altogether. Those same strategies and techniques are the ones that I want to provide to anyone who is preparing for their transition, or has started their career, but is in need of a spark, or even the hobbyist looking to learn more about programming. My philosophy is simple: _life is basic_, and that success only requires two things: effort and strategy - which **must** coexist.

With that being said, you all can expect a blog post every week centered around programming tutorials, career advice, and anything technical you all would like to learn about or get advice on. I'll also be uploading posts about things in tech that I find pretty interesting, so be on the look out for those as well. Do not hesitate to reach out to me about certain things you'd like for me to write about, or if you have any personal questions.

Don't forget to follow me on Instagram @1mturner and be on the lookout for other channels to connect with me on. Peace.
